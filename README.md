# Predictive-Analytics-for-Breast-Cancer


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a breast cancer dataset to classify malignant and benign tumors using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes various features extracted from cell nuclei, such as:
- **Mean values:** Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- **Standard error values:** Measures of statistical deviation.
- **Worst values:** Largest values recorded for each feature.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
   - Identifying categorical and numerical columns.
   - Normalization and feature scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing data distribution and feature correlations.
   - Detecting outliers using statistical methods.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Selecting the most relevant features for classification.
   
4. **Model Training:**
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Implementing classification algorithms such as Random Forest.
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Breast_Cancer.ipynb`).
2. Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, analyze features, and train the model.
3. Evaluate the classification results and fine-tune the model if needed.

## Results
The trained model aims to accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign, contributing to early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
